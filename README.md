# Agents - Morning Session

Our first task is to get a functioning extension up and running with a basic chat interface.

Your extension should:
- Have a panel with a text input and a send button. ‚úÖ
- Retain conversation context indefinitely*.
- Attach a file for context.

## This Template Includes

- ‚úÖ WebView UI components [webview.html](src/webview/webview.html)
- ‚úÖ Configuration setup for API keys [config.ts](src/config.ts)
- ‚úÖ Extension entry point [`extension.ts`](src/extension.ts)
- ‚úÖ Basic panel infrastructure [AIPanel.ts](src/panels/AIPanel.ts)

## You Need to Implement

- üõ†Ô∏è Chat functionality: [AIPanel.ts](src/panels/AIPanel.ts)
- üõ†Ô∏è A chat manager to handle conversations
- üõ†Ô∏è API integration

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalebsofer/agents-am

cd agent-workshop

npm install

npm run compile

# To test the extension, run in debugging mode:
# Press F5 or "Run, Start Debugging"
```

## API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key.

- Use your own if you have one. 
- I will ping a temporary key on Discord (OpenAI). 
- This template uses the OpenAI API, you are free to choose your preferred LLM.

Note, [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) is configured for OpenAI, you will need to tweak it for your preferred LLM.
